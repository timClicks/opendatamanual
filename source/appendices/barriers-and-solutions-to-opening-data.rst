Introduction
============

This format does not take the narrative approach of the rest of the
manual. Instead, bullet points taken mostly verbatim from the original 
meeting have been collected into themes. The themes include:

- Licensing
- Privacy
- 

The responses
in italics have been created by the Open Data Manual's authors.


Licensing
=========

General sentiment
-----------------

**Licencing is a pain**
    The fustrations over legalese can be minimised. There are now
    several publications which detail an appropriate license, including
    the :term:`Open Definition`. Additionally, many governments have
    gone through the process of determining appropriate licenses. They
    will be able to share their experience.

Poor initial conditions
-----------------------

**Absence of legal framework**
    If a country faces the problem of not having a sufficient legal
    framework, then it can fall back on several non-legislative policy
    which has been developed. For Europeans, a large corpora of texts
    have been gathered by the `ePSIplatform`_.

**Unclear licensing**
    This is less of an issue than it may have been during the meeting.
    The Open Definition provides an easily comprehendible guide to choosing
    an appropriate license.

**Ignorance of licensing**
    An ignorance of intellectual property, often compounded by an 
    unwillingness to learn more, is a difficult problem to be solved.
    Most officials and politicians understand the need to be clear about
    what is acceptable, to protect all parties. You can use this general 
    line of reasoning to talk about the specific case of data licensing.

**Concerns around intellectual property**
    Intellectual property rights can be unweildy. However, they are
    designed to give the owner of the rights control. Therefore, that
    control can be used to enforce open access with data that the 
    government controls.

**Licensing terms attached to datasets**
    Complex licenses increase barriers to entry. Governments should seek
    to minimise the complexity to the contract terms that they impose.
    Preferably, those contracts should be :term:`open` and easily
    understood.

**Proliferation of semi-custom terms in licenses**
    Open data is a relatively new field. This means that there are few
    established norms. As time progresses, we can expect to see a 
    maturation in licensing schemes. Schemes will consolodate, reducing
    cost and complexity.

**Incompatible open licenses**
    See previous.

**Share-alike licenses create silos**
    Emerging community standards and peer pressure will reduce this 
    problem over time.

Larger scale needed
-------------------

**Crossborder licensing needed for legal interoperability**
    Streamlining legislation and policy between countries
    takes a long time. Progress is being made. However, even in cases
    where the legislation is not uniform, great value can be derived
    from doing something locally. Local businesses and community
    groups will be more than happy to use local data of their own
    area, irrespective of what is happening in other countries.

**Concern to keep own national perspective on licensing is often
bigger than actual international differences**
    This is an important consideration. It can sometimes be important
    to create a consistent local understanding of the issues before
    embarking on a process of international collaboration.

**Most licensing initatives are single jurisdiction/sector**
    This is at least partially to blame on intellectual property laws.
    They are all national in scope. Moreover, open government data are
    produced by governments. Government are also national in scope.
    With those two considerations in mind, it is perfectly natural
    that licensing is national. As time progresses, those policies will
    naturally streamline through a process of collaboration

**Lack of harmonization between various EU level initiatives and 
projects, which risks fragmentation**
    While EU policy is never in perfect harmony, the trend tends is 
    trending towards openness.


Privacy
=======

**Use of privacy concerns to prevent all discussion**
    Privacy concerns can stifle brash action. This can be positive, as
    it can lead to greater consideration of the risks and benefits. With
    that in mind, all parties should reference their country's legislation
    to get a full picture of what is and is not restricted.

**Privacy legislation**
    Privacy legislation only covers private information. Much of government
    data is not private. Therefore, arguments should be made for extracting
    that data out of government, before moving to contentous issues.

**Governments are concerned for people's privacy**
    See above.

**Concern around personal data**
    See above.


Access
======

**Digital divide** 
    Data require special analysis and interpretation before they are able 
    to inform discussion. Only a small number of technical specialists 
    can gain access intially. Notwithstanding that, those specialists
    are often in a position where they can make the data much more 
    accessible than things currently stand.

**Multiple languages required**
    In regions where multiple and minority languages are spoken, efforts
    should be made to include the entire population. There is indeed a 
    risk of segmenting the benefits to populations along linguistic 
    boundaries. However, technology alo presents opportunities. Websites 
    are much more easily able to be translated by machines than paper.

From access to new business
===========================

Increasing access to data
-------------------------

**Access to data is political, not technical**
    Political climate is changing. Many governments around the world are 
    moving towards openness.

**Getting data**
    There are many more data catalogues available than was the case in 
    2010. Many of those catalogues provide easy access to the raw data
    in a direct manner. This shows that as the environment matures, the
    tools become more accessible to everyone.

**Lack of standard open data policies**
    This is changing, with governments using each others' policies to 
    come together towards common standards. For example, New Zealand
    created its open access policy NZGOAL, which was then followed by
    Australia's AUSGOAL.

**Too many data sources are not exposed yet**
    As governments become more experienced with releasing data, they
    will be in a better position to release data that is more difficult
    to access. Lots of data are locked up in legacy systems. As those
    systems are replaced, local advocates are well positioned to make
    the case for open data to be considered.

**Access to data is still largest issue**
    Hopefully things have come some way since 2010. The quantity and 
    quality of data releases have substancially increased in recent
    times. 

Publishing data
---------------

**Inconsistent and diverse formats**
    Data formats are created to solve particular problems. Those problems
    are often sector-specific. Therefore, multiple formats are not a
    bad thing per se. Notwithstanding this, it is important to prevent
    this creep if at all possible. Data transferred over the web are
    moving towards the :term:`JSON` data format. Where required, such
    as in the geospatial area, :term:`KML`, an :term:`XML` language is 
    very popular. The most important factor is to provide the ability
    for third parties to easily read the data, which necessitates 
    text rather than binary formats.

**Transformation of data for publishing, ensuring correct tranformation**
    When a government department needs to transform data in order for
    it to be used by the public, then there is always a risk of introducing
    corruption. Where possible, government departments should seek to 
    provide access to the raw data. When it is not, automated processes
    should be created and followed for undertaking the transformation. 

**Lack of standards, or ad hoc standards**
    Standards are emerging within communities of interest. For example, 
    within the Linked Open Data cloud, there are requirements to create
    a full record at `thedatahub.org`_ with explicit and complete 
    metadata.

**Storing big data**
    Many private sector providers have taken it upon themselves to solve
    this problem for governments. They often provide bandwidth and storage
    for public data at no cost to the data owner.

Finding and combining data
--------------------------

**Lots of fragmented sources**
    Public data are now being indexed by specialised search engines.
    This removes a large degree of the previous problems.

**Lack of interoperability**
    Interoperability concerns are particularly difficult when 
    encountering non-open systems. Where possible, governments should
    seek to move to vendor-neutral, patent and licence free data 
    formats.

**Lack of info on what reusable data is there**
    `thedatahub.org`_ is one of many services that provides information
    on public data. Its focus is on outlining exactly which data sets
    are released under open licenses.

**Disparity of data sets**
    The disparity of data reflects the disparities of the world. Some
    areas simply do not collect data that others do.

**Unclear what data is there**
    This uncertainty will hopefully reduce over time. There are now large
    volumes of open data available in several fields.

**Limited quality of data**
    Data can be of poor quality. Wherever possible, governments should 
    seek to provide raw data. They can then work with third parties to 
    build cleaner, more usable datasets for everyone.

**Lack of findability of data**
    See "Lots of fragmented sources".

**No unifed data structures in Europe**
    Data standards are often formed along sectorial lines, rather than 
    national borders. If there is no prospect of consistency within Europe, 
    try to build consistency within industries or disciplines.

**Lack of metadata**
    Many sectors are increasingly creating their own catalogues for their
    data. These catalogues often include excellent metadata. Where this
    has not yet happened, services such as `thedatahub.org`_ provide some
    ability to relieve these problems. 


Reuse
-----

**Concern about usefulness of data**
    Not all data are highly valuable. Yet, this fact should not be a 
    general barrier the distribution of open data.

**Unclear conditions for reuse**
    Efforts such as the :open:`Open Definition` provide a measure of
    clarity within the fog. Unfortunately, there is a large 
    proliferation of licenses used in the open data world. If you are
    considering to ignore a dataset because of licensing terms, make
    sure that you inform the owner of that. The owner may be in a 
    position to amend their terms.

**Limited user friendliess / information overload**
    Data analysis is a technical skill. Yet, the skilled analysts are
    exactly the people who will be able to make data more user friendly
    and reduce the overload caused by floods of information. They are
    able to work with designers to generate lovely infographics. They
    are able to work with writers to consisely explain the trends and
    implications of data that are otherwise indecipherable.

**Unclear data provenance**
    Where the origin of data is genuinely unclear, provenance can be 
    a significant concern. We need to know where data came from in 
    order to be able to trust it. Without that trust, it is impossible
    to rely on it for analysis. However, there may be other uses which 
    do not have such stringent requirements. Students could be given
    that dataset to practice their skills. The origins of the actual
    data are in this case irrelevant. All that matters here is that
    ther data are in a format that can be easily read.


Finding viable business models
==============================

**Working with data is not easy**
    This difficulty could be exactly where the business opportunities
    lie.

**Starting local/small is not always possible, e.g. have to take MS at once for tenders**
    Smaller businesses are also better placed to be nimble enough to 
    take on less visible, riskier opportunities.

**Scalability issues**
    Concerns of scalability in open data business models are likely
    to be no worse than similiar concerns in other fields.

**Data users still reluctant, mostly early innovators**
    This is natural. As the open data movement matures, it will
    become more accessible to a wider audience.

**Lack of business models**
    The lack of business models currently is not in itself a reason
    to hold back on open data. Open government data can be used to
    lessen the costs of undertaking current business models, even
    without reference to any future effort that is yet unthought of.


Disruption of existing business
===============================

Current changing
----------------

**Some public sector bodies have no choice but to charge for data**
    Many agencies were created under a model of generating a revenue 
    stream from the data that they collect. That fact in itself does
    not limit the applicability of the general argument surrounding
    pricing at marginal cost. Where the marginal cost of distributing
    data is negligible, the price should be zero.

**Concern about reduced income to public sector bodies**
    Income is likely to reduce if the current policy is to charge for
    access. Expenses may also decrease, as productivity gains from
    operating in an open manner are revealed.

**Existing charging models**
    See above.

What charging hinders
---------------------

**Unclear where decision on charging lies**
    Responsibility for this depends on local circumstances.

**Pricing models block market development by introducing arbitrary threshold for market entry**
    One thing to note is that removing pricing may only lead
    to a small increase in activity in the near term. There 
    remain very significant business risks for creating 
    products from an open data market. Public sector agencies 
    need to provide certainty that their open data stance 
    will be long-lived.

**Lower end of reuse market cannot exist for now**
    The lower end of the market will take a fairly long time
    to develop, even when open data is widespread. The market
    participants at this segment have less capability and 
    are unlikely to be able to execute new, profitable ideas.


Different perspectives
----------------------

**Some have stake in non-open data**
    Conflicting interests are not unqiue to this area. Where 
    interests do conflict, policy should seek to minimise any
    negative impact caused by this situation.

**Media and journalism like to have exclusive access**
    Providing open access to data does not provide open access
    to stories that emerge from that data. Data mining is complex 
    and expensive. Data can be thought of as raw materials. Media
    outlets are positioned differently to refine these raw materials. 

**You cannot compete against free**
    Yes, you can. Many businesses are built on providing a more
    convienent or more tailored service than a free alternative.
    Consider the case of bottled water.

Where not charging disrupts
-----------------------------

**Public sector bodies in direct competition with market with services
based on their data which they also sell**

Resellers will be nudged towards the value-added market segments.
However, they also provide a convienent level of service and are
also able to market their services effectively. Therefore,
the disruption to the current data market may be radical, but is
unlikely to be terminal.

**Current markets seeing disruption (e.g. publishers) because
of governments' publishing data sets with added value**

See above.


Linked and Federated Data
=========================

Linked Data
-----------

* storage concerns
* search/browsing/exploration challenges
* manual revision challenges
* classification challenges
* extraction challenges
* interlinking of data challenges
* quality analysis challenges
* evolution/repair challenges

Jurisdictional
--------------

**National authorities are neither financed nor mandated to create 
international interoperability**

That may appear to be the case on paper, however in practice there
are very strong incentives to undertake practices which lead to
international interoperability. There is more collaboration between
academics of the same discipline between continents than there is
between academics of differing disciplnes at the same university.
Industries are also highly globalised. There are often international
standards, codes of practice and norms which lend themselves to 
consistency between countries. Lastly, national authorities are much
more likely to adopted accept international best practice than take
on the cost of developing their own standards.

General
-------

**No unified data structures**

Linked Data is an exciting prospect. There is likely to be a large
degree of reliance on this technology to be able to bridge current
concerns.

**Needed level/scale may superseed current stakeholders**

Do not underestimate the need to be able to meet the needs of local
stakeholders. Grand, beautifully designed policy frameworks are 
wonderful. Yet, to a family interested in the water quality of the 
river, a spreadsheet is much more practical.

Transition Process for Government
=================================

Lack of knowledge and awareness
-------------------------------

**General resistance to overcome**

Cyncism is often accompanied with cost concerns and worries that 
job scope will increase without any recognition. Once the concerns
are allayed, managed or resolved, then the resistance will be 
overcome.


**Drivers are often external**

Pressure from the outside can sometimes move governments the fastest.
There must be external demand to justify that governments should 
supply.


**Closed government culture**

Government is heterogenous. While some aspects of government are
very closed, others are not. Start by talking to the receptive listeners.


**Barriers are often internal**

The fact that a barrier stands in the way is not by itself a sound
rationale for inaction. Instead, the costs and benefits of overcoming 
that hurdle should be weighed against the relative costs and benefits
of other options. The relative position of different options should
determine what action is undertaken, rather than the absolute value
of any obstacles.


**Lack of knowledge (data holders and users)**

Local open data communities hold a wealth of knowledge. Officials 
should be able to trust their users. They should create relationships,
just as commercial suppliers create relationships with their customers.


**Lack of awareness**

Awareness is quickly increasing. The open data movement is no
longer new. This means that there is far more information to
bring people up to speed than there once was.

Change is hard
--------------

**Risk of overcomplicating issues**

There is not a single type of open government data system. As 
the body of the Open Data Manual explains, it is possible to 
have a perfectly functioning open data that fits in well with 
many budgets, cultures and technical infrastructures.

**Government is concerned by complexity**

Governments only need to absorb as much complexity as they think
is practical. If a huge range of policies need to be adapted to
fit into an open data framework, then start with data sets which
are simpler. If a legacy system would be too expensive to move into
an open data environment, make that fact public.

**Tensions exist between those sticking to old roles and those trying 
to adapt to new ones**

Tensions between old and new are perennial. This fact in itself
should not prevent any change from occurring.


Losing control, feeling disrupted
---------------------------------

**Government is concerned by losing control**

    Government also has a mandate to act in the best interests of its
    citizens and residents. The fear of losing control is one based out
    of a lack of experience with this particular area. As more and more
    examples of useful things being created with open data, that fear
    of losing control will ease. 

**No inexpensive conflict resolution**

The data owner retains ownership. For the public sector, it holds 
significant power if any conflict situation arises.

**Data is power**

Data is often unrealised power. Data is collected by governments for 
specific purposes. They do not have the flexibiity to experiment with 
using that data in ways which were not anticipated. 

**Data catalogues perceived as centralisation (loss of power and control)**

Data catalogues are created simply to make things easier for consumers
of the data. While this may be perceived as the loss of power or control,
it is also the adoption of responsibility for support and upkeep by a 
central agency.

**Government is concerned by a lack of security**

See the security section, below.


Language
--------

**Different stakeholders speak languages, e.g. legal vs technical**
    This is likely to be a transient issue. All parties will 
    increasingly be able to communicate with each other as the 
    open data movement matures.

**Lack of common vocabulary**
    See previous.

Seeking viable ways forward
---------------------------

**Public service does not see own need for open data**

Officials talk. As open government data spreads, news of its 
positive effects inside of government will be spread too.

**Government's concern about open data's long term sustainability**

The ability for the private sector to be able to consume, process
and analyse large volumes of data will not decrease. Nor will its
demand. The sustainability of individual open data intiatives is
less certain. Public sector managers should seek to develop
programmes which will be financially viable across changes of 
governments.


**Uncertain economic impact**

The economic uncertainties of open data are real. However, this 
justification for open government data is not purely financial.


**Little empirical evidence**

Empirical evidence is growing.

Security
--------

Security threats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If data owners are concern about security threats for distributing
data openly, then they should third party services.


Fear of data manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once data have been modified, it would be a 
misrepresentation for the data's modifier to claim that it is the original
data. Therefore, if some harm is caused on the basis of that 
modification and/or misrepresentation, it's likely that the data owner
would have some form of legal recourse to be able to insulate themselves. 


Selective use of the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Effective communication is key. Data owners should be up-front 
with their data's limitations. This information can be included
as a seperate file along with the source data or be displayed 
along side a download link or similiar.


Legal challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data owners are in a position to disclaim any responsibility for 
reliance on the data's accuracy in their terms of use.


Where does responsibility lie?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Responsibility for security threats lies where it currently does.


Costs of transition
-------------------

**It's not as cheap as you may claim**

There is more than one way to undertake an open data program. As we
discuss within the manual, there are many alternatives to building 
a full service API. Many of those will be close to no cost.

**Government procedures take a long time to change**

They do. However, they are changing. Open data is no longer new. 

**No funds for transition**

Start with changes which are likely to save money and increase 
efficiency. If there are data sets which different departments, or
branches within departments need to go through a complicated 
process to access? If not, consider the difficulties that are 
currently required to access data from other levels of government.
Each of these transaction costs impose a burden on officials. 

**The cost of transition falls with data owner, but revenue is gathered 
centrally by another agency**

This is where a whole of government approach is required. There are
circumstances where it is appropriate to look at a systems level to
see the impact of current policy.

**It's not as expensive as you fear**
We hope the Open Data Manual can go some way to minimising any costs
whcih are incurred.
